# ESX_NP_SKINSHOP_V2

## ABOUT THIS VERSION

It's a simple NUI that allows people to browse all game clothes and change theirs by clicking on the images. It also detects whether the player is Male or Female and assigns the correct images.

This **`v2`** version have all the images in a local way, no more links to external websites and now there is support for **`esx_accessories`**, just use my edit of that script

This is a merge between the original 'np_skinshop' and 'esx_clotheshop', its working without issues and includes an outfit menu
